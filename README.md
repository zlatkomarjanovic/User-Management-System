# Greetings Mistral

### Welcome to User Management Github page

## Before proceeding with testing please make sure to install all the necessary dependencies.

## Instructions:

- When in the root directory run - "cd ./client"
- Run - "npm install" (This will install all the necessary dependencies)
- Go back in the root directory by running - "cd.."
- When in the root directory run - "cd ./server"
- Run - "npm install" again, to install all the necessary dependencies

## Commands to run:

- "cd ./server" && "npm run dev" - starts the entire app
- "cd ./server" && "npm start server" - starts the server on localhost:5000
- "cd ./client" && "npm start" - starts the front-end on localhost:3000

Concurrently is installed as a dependency in a server folder. Therefore when you install both dependencies on client and server side, you finally go back to server side, and simply run the command - "npm run dev" to start the entire application.


Thank you for your time 

Happy testing :D
